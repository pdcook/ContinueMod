----------
This is a BepInEx compatible mod for Rounds that adds a "Continue?" option at the end of a game.

Continuing adds more rounds to the current game, all players keep their current cards.

Use the F1 menu to change the number of rounds added when continuing, default is 2.

If you choose not to continue, you will still be offered the chance to rematch.

Not compatible with current version of the Rounds With Friends mod.

Thanks to Ascyst for help testing this and for providing useful code in his SetRounds mod.
